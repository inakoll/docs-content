Kubernetes Kapsule clusters benefit from regular updates to their [node images](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-node-images/). To profit from the latest features, it is important to stay up-to-date by upgrading these images. 
This guide outlines the process for upgrading node images in your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster and provides instructions on updating node pool images without changing the Kubernetes version.

<Message type="tip">
  If you wish to upgrade the Kubernetes version of your cluster, refer to the documentation on [Upgrading a Kubernetes Cluster](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/upgrade-kubernets-version/).

## Node Image Upgrade Process

### Automatic Upgrade for Kubernetes 1.30 or later

For Kubernetes clusters running version `>=1.30`, the new node image is applied automatically to all clusters created using this version. To upgrade the version of your node image, follow these steps:

1. Click **Kubernetes** under **Containers** on the side menu. A list of your Kubernetes Kapsule clusters displays.
2. Click the cluster name you wish to upgrade the pool. The cluster information page displays.
3. Navigate to the cluster's configuration settings and select the option to upgrade node pools. This process will automatically apply the latest node image to your cluster.

### Hybrid Roll-out Strategy for Kubernetes 1.29 or earlier

For Kubernetes clusters running version `<=1.29`, a hybrid roll-out strategy is implemented. Follow these steps to upgrade node images in such clusters:

* **Automatic deployment for new nodes:**
   - Any newly created node is automatically deployed using the new image system.
   - Nodes created through auto-scaling are also deployed using the new system.
* **Transition for replaced nodes:**
   - Replaced nodes transition to the new image system as part of the upgrade process.
* **New node pool deployment:**
   - Any new node pool is deployed using the new node image.
* **Legacy nodes maintenance:**
   - Legacy nodes, including upgraded nodes, maintain the older system for backward compatibility.
