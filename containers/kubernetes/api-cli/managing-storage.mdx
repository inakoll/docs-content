<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Kubernetes cluster running on Scaleway Instances (v1.21+)
</Message>

The Scaleway Block Volume CSI driver is responsible for the management of Scaleway Block Volumes within Kubernetes. Pre-installed on Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos clusters, this driver allows you to control Block Volumes directly from your orchestration environment. The plugin resides in the `kube-system` namespace within the pods.

<Message type="tip">
    Refer to our video tutorial [Getting Started with Kubernetes Part 4 - Storage](/containers/kubernetes/videos/) to view a visual presentation and step-by-step guidance of how to manage Block Storage volumes on Kubernetes with the Scaleway CSI.
</Message>

## Verification of CSI driver status

To verify if the driver is running, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get csidriver
```

The output of this command provides a quick status update on the CSI plugin within your Kubernetes cluster. For the latest features and enhancements, consider upgrading to [release 0.3](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-csi/tree/release-0.3#block-storage-low-latency), which supports **[Block Storage low latency](/storage/block/quickstart/)** volumes.

To identify your current CSI release version, navigate to the [Cockpit interface](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/), specifically the **Kubernetes Cluster - Overview** dashboard.

<Message type="note">
   * In February 2024, block volumes and snapshots management will transition to the [Scaleway Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/). This means you can view your block volumes in the [Block Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage/volumes) section of the Scaleway console.
   * Anticipate the availability of the **boot on block** feature for low-latency Block Storage volumes in Q2.

## Upgrading to CSI version 0.3

1. Initiate the migration process by adding the following tag to your cluster:
   ```bash
   enable-csi-v0.3=migrate
   ```
2. After updating the cluster tag, the cluster switches to the _updating_ status, indicating the deployment of the new CSI v0.3 on your nodes.

    <Message type="important">
        Once the migration to CSI v0.3 is initiated, a **rollback to CSI v0.2 is impossible**.
    </Message>

    <Message type="note">
      Note: This migration process applies to PVCs (Persistent Volume Claims) and snapshots only. System volumes remain on the Instances side, unaffected by this migration.
    </Message>

3. Upon completion of the migration process, verify the successful transfer of PVCs and snapshots to the [SBS-API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/).

      * `sbs-5k` and `sbs-15k` are pre-configured storage classes designed to meet your IOPS requirements. You can achieve the equivalent of setting `iops:5k` in your custom class.
      * Until Q2 2024, 15k IOPS are not yet available in the following AZ: PAR3, AMS2, WAW1, WAW2
